* To help users better do city exploration with respect to what they are familiar with, we developed an Android app, whose name is “Home Away From Home”.
* This is a project in the course **"User Interface Design"**, which is given by [prof. Joseph Konstan](http://konstan.umn.edu/) and [prof. Loren Terveen](http://www-users.cs.umn.edu/~terveen/). This is an excellent course, I have learned a lot from it. 
* One of the textbooks, **“The Design of Everyday Things”**, written by Don Norman, changes my cognition and understanding toward design work. 
* From the course project, I combined Design theories and practice successfully. I have learned how to go through the whole design process, from getting the **right design** to getting the **design right**: Miscellaneous ideas, User research, Paper prototype, Cognitive walkthrough, Heuristic evaluation, Implementation, Usability testing and team work.
