title: 'Measurement System of Radiated Emission Based on Current Probe'
excerpt: "<strong>Cooperated with Mitsubishi Heavy Industries</strong>, Finished in May 2010 <br><br>Considering the complex process and high cost of radiation emission measurement in anechoic chamber, 
I developed a measurement system based on a current probe in common laboratory, reducing the cost of test dramatically while measurement accuracy is maintained."

Considering the complex process and high cost of radiation emission measurement in anechoic chamber, 
I developed a measurement system based on a current probe in common laboratory, reducing the cost of test dramatically while measurement accuracy is maintained.
