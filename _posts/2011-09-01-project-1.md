title: 'Stock Market Prediction based on Neural Networks'
excerpt: "**Empirical Finance & Financial Econometrics Workshop**, finished in November 2011, CCER, Peking University <br><br>
In this project, I proposed to use neural networks model to predict stock market trends, the performance of prediction is compared to other prediction models such as GARCH model"

* This idea is from my research on behavioral modeling of power amplifier. The stock market is also a high nonlinearity system.
  So deep learning method could work. I tried it and the results are good. 
* I presented this method in a empirical finance & financial econometrics workshop in CCER and received positive comments from professor and interests from other students.
