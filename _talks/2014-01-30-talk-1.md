## Motivation
**Precision CrowdSourcing**: Making targeted information request to information consumers. The provision of information presents an opportunity to induce **reciprocity**: a desire to pay the site back by offering information that will help out future users.
We explicitly distinguish this work from **paid crowdsourcing** such as mTurk, and from the games; we are focusing on **reciprocity** and **belonging**, not compensation or entertainment.


## Basic Ideas
We seek to experimentally explore precision crowdsourcing in different implementations to explore a variety of contextual factors to shape the requests, and looking at both short term success rate and quality of responses and the long-term effect of such requests on user loyalty and participation.<br><br>
The basic ideas about the experiment design is to focus on three questions: **When? How? What?**
* **When** do we give the request, display a message immediately or email next day after an userâ€™s action ?
* **How** to give the request, reciprocity or neutral appeal ?
* **What** contributions we hope the users to do ?
