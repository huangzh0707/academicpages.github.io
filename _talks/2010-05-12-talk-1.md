**Summary**: A novel low cost radiated emission measurement system by using current probe has been proposed in this paper. Compared with conventional anechoic chamber measurement method, this new method could reduce test cost and save developing time efficiently. In order to improve the accuracy, a transfer function has been built for mapping the relationship between current probe method and anechoic chamber method. By using the interpolation, the final estimated radiation emission has been validated and agreed well with the experimental results in anechoic chamber.
