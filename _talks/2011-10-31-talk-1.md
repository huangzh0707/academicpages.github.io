**Summary**: This idea is from my research on behavioral modeling of power amplifier. The stock market is also a high nonlinearity system.
 So deep learning method could work. I tried it and the results are good. 
 I presented this method in a empirical finance & financial econometrics workshop in CCER and received positive comments from professor and interests from other students.
