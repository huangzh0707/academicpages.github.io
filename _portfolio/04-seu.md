## Study
* I finished my undergraduate education here. My major is Information Engineering. 
* I systematically studied core courses about EE (Electrical Engineering, Electrical Engineering), which established the basis for my future study and research.

## Impressions
* **Peace**: Nanjing is a peaceful city. The pace of life is not so rush as other big cities.
* **Campus**: Southeast University is also peaceful, like Nanjing, which is a good place for study.
